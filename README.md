## Desktop GUI MVP

This repository also contains the first deliverable of a safety-first desktop
GUI in [`apps/desktop`](apps/desktop). It implements the user flow “preset →
configure → scan → preview → execute → result”, plus history, undo and a
quarantine area. The desktop shell is Tauri 2, the UI is Vue 3/TypeScript, and
the local Python engine communicates over NDJSON.

Run the browser demo:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the desktop application (requires Rust):

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run tauri dev
```

Run the engine tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s engine/tests -v
```


## v3 is now available

The new version should be *much* faster and fix a lot of bugs. It also comes with
a some new actions, filters and options.

If you encounter any other bugs or problems during the migration, please reach out!

- [See the changelog](https://tfeldmann.github.io/organize/changelog/)
- [Migration guide](https://tfeldmann.github.io/organize/migrating/#migrating-from-v2-to-v3)

## About

Your desktop is a mess? You cannot find anything in your downloads and
documents? Sorting and renaming all these files by hand is too tedious?
Time to automate it once and benefit from it forever.

**organize** is a command line, open-source alternative to apps like Hazel (macOS)
or File Juggler (Windows).

### People use this for:

- Sorting and tagging pictures into various folder structures based on EXIF data
- Sorting and renaming PDF invoices based on file content
- Removing incomplete downloads from their ~/Downloads
- Cleaning up their ~/Desktop from unused files
- Freeing up disk space by removing duplicates
- Automating various business processes
- and many more

## Features

Some highlights include:

- Safe moving, renaming, copying of files and folders with conflict resolution options.
- Fast duplicate file detection.
- Exif tags extraction.
- Categorization via text extracted from PDF, DOCX and many more.
- Powerful template engine.
- Inline python and shell commands as filters and actions for maximum flexibility.
- Everything can be simulated before touching your files.
- Works on macOS, Windows and Linux.
- Free and open source software.

## Getting started

### Installation

Only python 3.9+ is needed.
Install it via your package manager or from [python.org](https://python.org).

Installation is done via pip. Note that the package name is `organize-tool`:

```bash
pip install -U organize-tool
```

This command can also be used to update to the newest version. Now you can run `organize --help` to check if the installation was successful.

### Create your first rule

In your shell, run `organize new` and then `organize edit` to edit the configuration:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Find PDFs"
    locations:
      - ~/Downloads
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      - extension: pdf
    actions:
      - echo: "Found PDF!"
```

> If you have problems editing the configuration you can run `organize show --reveal` to reveal the configuration folder in your file manager. You can then edit the `config.yaml` in your favourite editor.

save your config file and run:

```sh
organize run
```

You will see a list of all `.pdf` files you have in your downloads folder (+ subfolders).
For now we only show the text `Found PDF!` for each file, but this will change soon...
(If it shows `Nothing to do` you simply don't have any pdfs in your downloads folder).

Run `organize edit` again and add a `move`-action to your rule:

```yml
actions:
  - echo: "Found PDF!"
  - move: ~/Documents/PDFs/
```

Now run `organize sim` to see what would happen without touching your files.

You will see that your pdf-files would be moved over to your `Documents/PDFs` folder.

Congratulations, you just automated your first task. You can now run `organize run`
whenever you like and all your pdfs are a bit more organized. It's that easy.

> There is so much more. You want to rename / copy files, run custom shell- or python scripts, match names with regular expressions or use placeholder variables? organize has you covered. Have a look at the advanced usage example below!

## Example rules

Here are some examples of simple organization and cleanup rules. Modify to your needs!

Move all invoices, orders or purchase documents into your documents folder:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Sort my invoices and receipts"
    locations: ~/Downloads
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      - extension: pdf
      - name:
          contains:
            - Invoice
            - Order
            - Purchase
          case_sensitive: false
    actions:
      - move: ~/Documents/Shopping/
```

Recursively delete all empty directories:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Recursively delete all empty directories"
    locations:
      - path: ~/Downloads
    targets: dirs
    subfolders: true
    filters:
      - empty
    actions:
      - delete
```

<!--<details markdown="1">
  <summary markdown="1">Advanced example</summary>

This example shows some advanced features like placeholder variables, pluggable
actions, limited recursion through subfolders and filesystems (FTP and ZIP):

This rule:

- Searches recursively in your documents folder (three levels deep) and on a FTP server
- for files with **pdf** or **docx** extension
- that have a created timestamp
- Asks for user confirmation for each file
- Moves them according to their extensions and **created** timestamps:
- `script.docx` will be moved to `~/Documents/DOCX/2018-01/script.docx`
- `demo.pdf` will be moved to `~/Documents/PDF/2016-12/demo.pdf`
- If this new is already taken, a counter is appended to the filename ("rename_new")
- Creates a zip backup file on your desktop containing all files.

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Download, cleanup and backup"
    locations:
      - path: ~/Documents
        max_depth: 3
      - path: ftps://demo:demo@demo.wftpserver.com
    filters:
      - extension:
          - pdf
          - docx
      - created
    actions:
      - confirm:
          msg: "Really continue?"
          default: true
      - move:
          dest: "~/Documents/{extension.upper()}/{created.strftime('%Y-%m')}/"
          on_conflict: rename_new
      - copy: "zip:///example/backup.zip"
```
